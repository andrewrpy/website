The [**Topic Model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) is a type of statistical model to find the topics that occur in a collection of documents.
It is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. For example, image to have some articles or a series of social media messages and we want to understand what is going on inside of them. A common tool to face this problem is via **Unsupervised Machine Learning model**. </br>
From a high level perspective, having a bunch of documents, and like in [**K-Mean Clustering**](https://www.andreaperlato.com/theorypost/introduction-to-k-means-and-hierarchical-clustering/) we want to find the **K** number of topics that best describe our corpus of text.
