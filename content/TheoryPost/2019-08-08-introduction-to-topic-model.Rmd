The [**Topic Model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) is a type of statistical model to find the topics that occur in a collection of documents.
It is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. For example, image to have some articles or a series of social media messages and we want to understand what is going on inside of them. A common tool to face this problem is via **Unsupervised Machine Learning model**.
From a high level perspective, having a bunch of documents, and like in [**K-Mean Clustering**](https://www.andreaperlato.com/theorypost/introduction-to-k-means-and-hierarchical-clustering/) we want to find the **K** number of topics that best describe our corpus of text.

From the figure above, we have three different topics: technology (yellow), business(orange), and arts(blue).
In addition to those topics, we also have an association to the documents to topics. In fact, a document can be entirely a technology topic (i.e. red light, green light, 2-tone led, simplify screen), but also a document that is a sort of mixture of two or more topic (see the grey text in the figure below).

Topic Modelcan be seen as a **Matrix Factorization Problem**, where **K** is the number of topics, **M** is the number of documents, and **V** is the size of the vocabulary.

The **MxV** matrix corrisponds to the distribution of the words for each of the topics,and to find this the [**Latent Semantic Analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis) is widely used.

An alternative of the **Matrix Factorization Problem** is the [**Generative Model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model). </br>
More particularly, the [**Latent Dirichlet Allocation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) is commonly used in topic modelling.
