<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model"><strong>Topic Model</strong></a> is a type of statistical model to find the topics that occur in a collection of documents.
It is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. For example, image to have some articles or a series of social media messages and we want to understand what is going on inside of them. A common tool to face this problem is via <strong>Unsupervised Machine Learning model</strong>. </br>
From a high level perspective, having a bunch of documents, and like in <a href="https://www.andreaperlato.com/theorypost/introduction-to-k-means-and-hierarchical-clustering/"><strong>K-Mean Clustering</strong></a> we want to find the <strong>K</strong> number of topics that best describe our corpus of text.</p>
