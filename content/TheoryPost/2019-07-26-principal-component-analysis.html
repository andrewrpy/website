<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"><strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong></a> is a deterministic method (given an input will always produce the same output). It is always good to perform a PCA: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a data reduction technique that transforms a larger number of correlated variables into a much smaller set of uncorrelated variables called <strong>Principal Components</strong>. For example, we might use PCA to transform many correlated (and possibly redundant) variables into a less number of uncorrelated variables that retain as much information from the original set of variables. </br></p>
<p>We can do that one step at a time using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition"><strong>Singular Vector Decomposition</strong></a>. </br>
Imagine we are measuring the transcription of two genes: Gene1 and Gene2 that are our variables and six different mice, that are our observations. Or using another example: 6 types of businesses and the variables could be market capitalization and number of employees. </br>
Now, tha mice 1, 2, 3 have high value for Gene1 and mice 4, 5, 6 have low value for Gene2. </br>
So, mice 1, 2, 3 are more similar to each other than they are to mice 4, 5, 6. </br></p>

<p>If we have more than 3 genes is quite difficult to use a four-dimensional graph to check where mice are allocated in that space. The Principal Component Analysis PCA, takes four or more-dimensional data and make a two-dimensional Principal Component Plot that is able to tell us which gene or variable is the most valuable for clustering the data. Now, letâ€™s assume that we have only two genes and we just calculate two averages: one for gene1 and one for gene2. With this average we have now the <strong>Centre Average</strong> of the data, and we can shift the data so that the average is the origin of the graph.</p>
