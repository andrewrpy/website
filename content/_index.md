This website has been designed to share information about Data Science. </br>
There are two main topics: **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**, both explained along with real world examples in **R** and **Python**.
Moreover, there is a specific session dedicated to **Time Series**, and a specific topic about the **Theory** underlying the main algorithms. 

The website is entirely built in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) with [**blogdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).
R is the best data specific programming language focused around data analyst and data scientist kind of process.
It is also one of the faster ways to build dashboards and web apps. </br>
