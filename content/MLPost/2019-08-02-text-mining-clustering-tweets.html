<p>We can use Unsupervised Classification (clustering) to learn more about text that we have to analyze. More specifically, we use <a href="https://www.andreaperlato.com/theorypost/introduction-to-k-means-and-hierarchical-clustering/"><strong>Hierarchical clustering</strong></a> to cluster our text into groups that are the propensity to occur together. In this example, text are some tweet about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Catalan_independence_referendum"><strong>Catalan Independence Referendum</strong></a>.</p>
