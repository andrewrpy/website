<p>We want to differentiate between spam (called spam) and non-spam (called ham) email based on the content. We use a training set of textual data that are already labeled spam/non-spam email.</p>
<p>We start removing empy columns, and we call our columns <strong>label</strong> and <strong>text</strong>.
We also create a corpus, remove punctuation, transform everything into lowercase, remove numbers, and stop words. Then, we have to stamming the document, and finally we have a corpus of terms. with out sparse terms. </br>
Finally, we can convert the corpus into a data frame, and add the dependent variable <strong>label</strong>. </br>
Now, we can split the data between Training and Test set.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(caTools)

# Remove empty columns
spam$X = NULL
spam$X.1 &lt;- NULL
spam$X.2 &lt;- NULL
names(spam) &lt;- c(&quot;label&quot;,&quot;text&quot;)
levels(as.factor(spam$label))</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;ham&quot;  &quot;spam&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Clean the text
corpus &lt;- Corpus(VectorSource(spam$text))
corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, removeNumbers)
corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, stripWhitespace)
corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords(&#39;english&#39;))
corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, stemDocument)

# Obtain document term matrix
myDtm &lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(corpus)
# findFreqTerms(myDtm, lowfreq=100)

sparse = removeSparseTerms(myDtm, 0.995) # remove words not appear 99.5% of the time

# Convert to a data frame
emailSparse = as.data.frame(as.matrix(sparse))
emailSparse$label=spam$label

# Add dependent variable
library(caTools)
set.seed(123)

n = nrow(emailSparse)
idx &lt;- sample(n, n * .75) # split data to testing and train set
train = emailSparse[idx,]
test = emailSparse[-idx,]</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_partitioning"><strong>Recursive Partitioning And Regression Trees Model</strong></a>.
This is a statistical method for Multivariable Analysis that is able to create a Decision Tree that try to classify terms by splitting it by dichotomous dependent variable, in this case label=ham (non-spam), label=spam. The method is called <strong>Recursive</strong> because each subpopulation may be splitted many number of times until a specific criteria is reached. The <strong>Advantages</strong> of Recursive Partitioning is that is an intuitive model which does not require a lot of calculations. The <strong>Disadvantage</strong> is that it can not work well with continuous variable because it may overfit data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

# Recursive Partitioning And Regression Trees Model
emailCART = rpart(label ~ ., data=train, method=&quot;class&quot;)
# summary(emailCART)

prp(emailCART) # plot the tree</code></pre>

<p>As we can see from the graph above, if the word <strong>call</strong> is less than 0.5 of probability and <strong>claim</strong> or <strong>mobil</strong> is less than 0.5, the email is a spam.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Evaluate the performance of the model
predictCART = predict(emailCART, newdata=test, type=&quot;class&quot;)
table(test$label, predictCART)</code></pre>
<pre><code>      predictCART
        ham spam
  ham  1180   26
  spam   60  127</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Overall accuracy
(1180+127)/(1180+127+60 +26)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 0.9382627</code></pre>
<p>The results above show the Confusion Matrix and the relative Accuracy (93%).
Based on a very simple Decision Trees Model we can identify email with a 93% of Accuracy. We are also able thanks to the graph above to see which predictors had an important role to identify if the email was spam or not.</p>
