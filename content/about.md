I started my career as a Data Scientist for more than 10 years ago in the field of Neuroscience at the University of Verona - School of Medicine, Italy. As point person in data analysis, I studied the single and multi-unit recordings from behaving non human primates. Moreover, I have been conducting psychophysical experiments on human subjects to investigate the brain plasticity in drug addicts. </br>

After years of scientific research, I finally discovered the great contribution that could have brought a scientific approach to the business data. In 2014, very few places were conscious about the role of data science, but I had the good fortune to work for one of these: [**Chorally**](https://chorally.com/). Thanks to Chorally, I used the best technology available for companies to obtain useful and usable information from their data. </br>
I also have extensive experience in the field of **Statistical Consultancy** and Data Science applied to **Marketing** and **Fraud Prevention**.

I conclude with the words of George Box:
[**all models are wrong, some models are useful**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).
