**In Romania, the voters did not win the election. The sharers did.** </br>
On November 16, 2014 Klaus Iohannis became the president of Romania and the most popular Romanian politician on internet, thanks to campaign mainly on Facebook.
In order to shed more light on the dynamics of decision-making we analized more than 60 000 Romanian Facebook comments during the election period.

**A poem changed the course of history**
The first idea was to divide the comments according to whether they were in favor of one of the two presidential candidates (Klaus Iohannis vs. Victor Ponta). Immediately, we realized that the main comments were referring to the protest of expatriate citizens that could not vote on their respective embassies, increasingly worried about a winning Ponta. We used the Topic Wheel visualization that offer a view of frequent terms in the Facebook conversation.

The figure above is the so called **Topic wheel** visualization: the inner ring represent frequently used terms and the outside ring provide a more granular look at terms and how they related to the topics of conversation.
