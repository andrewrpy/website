RNN is a **Supervised Deep Learning** used for **Time Series Analysis**. </br>
Recurrent Neural Networks represent one of the most advanced algorithms that exist in the world of supervised deep learning. </br>

**Frontal lobe and RNN** </br>
RNNs are like short-term memory. We will learn that they can remember things that just happen in a previous couple of observations and apply that knowledge in the going forward. For humans, short-term memory is one of the functions of the [**Frontal Lobe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe). </br>
