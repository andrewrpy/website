In this article we try to predict if a patient's diagnosis of breast tissue is malignant or bening. From the code below, using the **feature_names** function we can explore the name of all the predictors involved in the breast cancer such as for example: mean radius, mean perimeter and so forth. Moreover, using the funtion **target_names** we have the two level of the response variable (malignant, benign).
To have a better understanding of the dataset here the [**link**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Sys.which("python") # check py path
library(reticulate)
use_python("C:/Users/Utente/Anaconda3/python.exe", required=TRUE)

```

```{python, include=TRUE}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import nltk
import tensorflow as tf

from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer 
data = load_breast_cancer()
list(data.feature_names) # predictors
list(data.target_names) # response variable

```

Now, we can use the function **train_test_split** from **sklearn** and calling this function we can split the model with  a test set of 33% of the original data set.
