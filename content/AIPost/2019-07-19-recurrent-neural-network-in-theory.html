<p>RNN is a <strong>Supervised Deep Learning</strong> used for <strong>Time Series Analysis</strong>. </br>
Recurrent Neural Networks represent one of the most advanced algorithms that exist in the world of supervised deep learning. </br></p>
<p><strong>Frontal lobe and RNN</strong> </br>
RNNs are like short-term memory. We will learn that they can remember things that just happen in a previous couple of observations and apply that knowledge in the going forward. For humans, short-term memory is one of the functions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"><strong>Frontal Lobe</strong></a>. </br></p>
