<p>RNN is a <strong>Supervised Deep Learning</strong> used for <strong>Time Series Analysis</strong>. </br>
Recurrent Neural Networks represent one of the most advanced algorithms that exist in the world of supervised deep learning. </br></p>
<p><strong>Frontal lobe and RNN</strong> </br>
RNNs are like short-term memory. We will learn that they can remember things that just happen in a previous couple of observations and apply that knowledge in the going forward. For humans, short-term memory is one of the functions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"><strong>Frontal Lobe</strong></a>. </br></p>
<p><strong>The idea behind RNN</strong> </br>
The idea is that weights have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory"><strong>Long Term Memory</strong></a> abbreviated as <strong>LTM</strong>. For example, in a classical ANN known the weights, and so whatever input, we put into the ANN, it will process it in the same way as it would yesterday.
The weights can be located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"><strong>Temporal Lobe</strong></a> of a human brain, because the Temporal Lobe is responsible for Long Term Memory LTM. </br>
RNN is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory"><strong>Short Term Memory</strong></a>, because it can remember things that are just happened in the previous couple of observations. The figure below is a representation of RNN.</p>

<p>The circle in blue, that represent the hidden layer, is called the <strong>Temporal Loop</strong>,and they are connected through time. It is a sort of short term memory, able to remember what was in that neuron just previously. For example, when we have a lot of text, we need to gauge if it is a negative or a positive comment this RNN is called <strong>Many to One</strong>. </br></p>
