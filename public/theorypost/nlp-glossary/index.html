<p><strong>Text Similarity using Vector Space Model</strong> </br>
The idea is to find common words within text. The figure below shows an example with a text with common words “”house” and “white”. It represents all texts with common words, calculating the frequency of each word.</p>
<center>
<img src="/img/vectrspacemodel.png" style="width:40.0%" />
</center>
<p>For example, looking at the red point (2,7), 2 is the number of times that the word “white” appears in the text and 7 is the number of times that the word “house” appears in the same text. The blue and yellow points are examples in other texts. Looking at all the points, we have the representation of all text based on their frequency of common words. Now, if we want to evaluate how similar are the text, we can use two different metrics: </br>
1 - Euclidean Distance </br>
2 - Cosine Similarity </br>
The cosine similarity is the angle theta between two points. If the theta angle is little, means that the two points are close and as a consequence the two texts are closely related. On the contrary, if the angle is very large, the two texts are not similar. In the formula above, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are the vectors (where they start at 0 and arrive to the colored point).
The cosine similarity equation will result in a value between 0 and 1. The smaller cosine angle results in a bigger cosine value, indicating higher similarity. In this case Euclidean distance will be zero.</p>
<p><strong>Stemming vs. Lemmatization</strong> </br>
Stemming is the process of transforming words in their root word, for example: “carefully”, “cared”, “cares” can be considered as ”care” instead of separate words. </br>
Lemmatization: we need to have the inflected form of the word. For example the lemmatization of the word “ate” is “eat”. </br>
Stemming and Lemmatization both generate the root form of inflected words. The difference is that stem might not be an actual word whereas, lemma is an actual language word.
Stemming follows an algorithm with steps to perform on the words which makes it faster. Whereas, in lemmatization, you used WordNet corpus and a corpus for stop words as well to produce lemma which makes it slower than stemming. You also had to define a part-of-speech to obtain the correct lemma.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum edit distance &amp; Backrace method</strong> </br>
Minimum edit distance allows us to assess how similar two strings are. It is the minimum number of editing operations such as insertion, deletion and substitution that are needed to transform one into the other. As shown above, in order to turn “intention” to “execution” we need to do few edition. If each operation has a <strong>cost</strong> of 1, the distance between the word “intention” and “execution” is 5.
There are lots of distinct paths that wind up at the same state and we don’t have to keep track of all of them. We just need to keep track of the shortest path to each of those revised path. For this reason we can use the Backtrace method.</p>
<center>
<img src="/img/minimumeditdistance.png" style="width:40.0%" />
</center>
<p>We often need to align each character of the two strings to each other by keeping a <strong>backtrace</strong>. Every time we enter a cell, we need to remember where we came from and when we reach the end, trace back the path from the upper right corner to read off the alignment. The arrows in the graph below (starting from the upper right corner) allows you to trace back the path. For example, to go from “inte” to “e”, we could remove all 4 characters and insert a letter “e” but that would cost us a distance of 5. Alternatively, we could just remove “int” and get the remainder character “e”, costing us a distance of 3.
It is the way to correct grammar errors; maybe not necessary if we are working for example with scientific articles. </br></p>
<p><strong>Part of speech tag filter - POS</strong> </br>
In the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the most basic models are based on Bag of Words. But such models fail to capture the syntactic relations between words. For example, suppose we build a sentiment analyser based on only Bag of Words. Such a model will not be able to capture the difference between “I like you”, where “like” is a verb with a positive sentiment, and “I am like you”, where “like”" is a preposition with a neutral sentiment. </br>
POS tagging is the process of marking up a word in a corpus to a corresponding part of a speech tag, based on its context and definition. For example, in the sentence “Give me your answer”, answer is a Noun, but in the sentence “Answer the question”, answer is a verb. </br>
There are different techniques for POS Tagging: </br>
1 - Lexical Based Methods: assigns the POS tag the most frequently occurring in the training corpus. </br>
2 - Rule Based Methods: e.g. the “ed” or “ing” must be assigned to a verb. </br>
3 - Rule Based Method: RNN can be used to solve POS tagging. </br>
4 - Probabilistic Method: assigns the POS tag based on the probability of a particular tag sequence.
To have a description of POS look at this <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html"><strong>link</strong></a>.
Every word is represented by a <strong>feature tag</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Topic Analysis and LDA Hyperparameters</strong> </br>
One of he most popular topic algorithm is the <a href="https://www.andreaperlato.com/theorypost/introduction-to-topic-model/"><strong>LDA</strong></a>. It is of high importance to tune the hyperparameters: </br>
1 - Number of iterations. </br>
2 - Number of Topics: number of topics to be extracted using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence"><strong>Kullback Leibler Divergence Score</strong></a>. </br>
3 - Number of Topic Terms: number of terms composed in a single topic. </br>
4 - Alpha hyperparameter: represents document-topic density. </br>
5 - Beta hyperparameter: represent topic-word density. The alpha &amp; beta parameters are especially useful to find the right number of topics. </br>
6 - Batch Wise LDA: another tip to improve the model is to use corpus divided into batches of fixed sizes. We perform LDA on these batches multiple times and we should obtain different results, but strikingly, the best topic terms are always present. </br></p>
<p>It is often desirable to quantify the difference between probability distributions for a given random variable. The difference between two distribution is called:. <strong>statistical distance</strong>, but this can be challenging as it can be difficult to interpret the measure. ùin fact, it is more common to calculate a <strong>divergence</strong> between two probability distributions. Divergence is a scoring of how one distribution differs from another.
Two commonly used <strong>divergence scores</strong> from information theory are <strong>Kullback-Leibler Divergence KL</strong> and Jensen-Shannon Divergence.
The <strong>KL</strong> divergence between two distributions Q and P is often stated using the following notation: </br>
KL(P || Q) </br>
where the || operator indicates divergence of P from Q. </br>
KL divergence can be calculated as the positive sum of probability of each event in P multiplied by the log of the probability of the event in Q over the probability of the event in P: </br>
KL(P || Q) = – sum x in X P(x) * log(Q(x) / P(x)) </br>
the value within the sum is the divergence for a given event. </br>
The intuition for the KL divergence score is that when the probability for an event from P is large, but the probability for the same event in Q is small, there is a large divergence. When the probability from P is small and the probability from Q is large, there is also a large divergence, but not as large as the first case.</p>
<p>LDA uses some constructs like: </br>
1 - a document can have multiple topics (because of this multiplicity, we need the Dirichlet distribution); and there is a Dirichlet distribution which models this relation. </br>
2 - words can also belong to multiple topics, when you consider them outside of a document; so here we need another Dirichlet to model this. </br>
Now, in Bayesian inference you use the Bayes rule to infer the posterior probability. These distributions are hidden from data, this is why is called latent, or hidden.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(\theta | x)=\frac{p(x | \theta) p(\theta | \alpha)}{p(x | \alpha)} \Longleftrightarrow \text { posterior probability }=\frac{\text { likelihood } \times \text { prior probability }}{\text { marginal likelihood }}
\]</span>
The alpha parameter in he formula above is our initial belief about this distribution, and is the parameter of the prior distribution. Usually this is chosen in such a way that will have a <strong>conjugate prior</strong> (so the distribution of the posterior is the same with the distribution of the prior) and often to encode some knowledge if you have one or to have maximum entropy if you know nothing.
The parameters of the prior are called hyperparameters. In LDA, both topic distributions, over documents and over words have also correspondent priors, which are denoted usually with <strong>alpha</strong> and <strong>beta</strong>, and because are the parameters of the prior distributions are called hyperparameters.</p>
<p><strong>Recommender system in text mining</strong> </br>
Recommender system is designed to predict the user preference and how to recommend the right items in order to create a user personalization experience.
There are two types of recommender system: </br>
1 - Content based filtering: focused on the similarity attributes of the items to give recommendations. </br>
2 - Collaborative filtering: focused on the similarity attribute of the users finding people with similar tastes based on a similarity measure: <strong>memory based</strong> and <strong>model based</strong>.</p>
<center>
<img src="/img/recsys.png" style="width:40.0%" />
</center>
<p>From the figure above, the content based filtering is able to find similar items of the favorite items of the user, such as the mouse and the printer based on the keybord and the joystick. The recommendation is based on the similarity.
On the contrary, in the collaborative filtering is focused on the similarity attributes of the users, finding peole with similar traits based on a similarity measure. There are two measures: memory based and model based.</p>
<p>The <strong>memory based recommendation</strong> is looking items liked by similar people in order to create a ranked list of recommendations. We can sort the ranked list to recommend the top n items to the user.
The Person correlation and cosine similarity are used.
Here the Pearson correlation formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{simil}(x, y)=\frac{\sum_{i \in I_{y}}\left(r_{z, i}-\bar{r}_{z}\right)\left(r_{y, i}-\bar{r}_{y}\right)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i \in I_{y}}\left(r_{z, i}-\bar{r}_{z}\right)^{2}} \sqrt{\sum_{i \in I_{y}, i}}\left(r_{y, i}-\bar{r}_{y}\right)^{2}}
\]</span></p>
<p>and the cosine similarity formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{simil}(z, y)=\cos (\vec{x}, \vec{y})=\frac{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}}{|\vec{x}||\times| \vec{y}||}=\frac{\sum_{i \in I_{y}} r_{z, i} r_{y, i}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i \in l_{z}} r_{z, i}^{2}} \sqrt{\sum_{i \in l_{y}} r_{y, i}^{2}}}
\]</span>
The cosine similiarity formula (see on top of this article) makes sure how to separate two terms where each term is represented by a vector and we are interested in the angle between these two vectors. If the cosine similarity is close to 1, both terms are very similar.
In the memory based recommendation the <strong>similarity matrix is used</strong>.</p>
<center>
<img src="/img/similaritymatrix.png" style="width:60.0%" />
</center>
<p>From the figure above we can see on the left the <strong>item-item similarity</strong> which is calculated by looking into co-ranked items only. Form example, for the items <strong>i</strong> and <strong>j</strong> the similarity is computed by calculating similarity between rating the i and j columns (items) but only in the cells where we have a rate (blue rectangles). Another approach is to use the <strong>user-item similarity</strong>, on the right of the figure above. This approach is looking into correlated items only in rows (users).</p>
<p>A pratical application is about scientific publications. The amount of digital text data is growing exponentially and it is time consuming for researchers to find relevant information and the researched more connected to the same area of research. We can use the following variabels: </br>
1 - user: the name of researchers </br>
2 - topics: the specific area of research </br>
3 - cites: number of quotes received by an article </br>
4 - date: date of publication used as a cut-off to split the data between train and test set </br>
Having there variables we can implement a ANN to find attribute of the users finding researchers with similar influence on a specific topic based on a the number of quotes (collaborative filtering).
We can also try to use a more simple approach: <strong>content based filtering</strong>. </br></p>
<p><strong>Content based filtering applied to scientific publications</strong> </br>
The content based filtering recommend items (scientific articles) based on the attributes of those items themselves.
The figure below is an example of the <strong>cosine similarity</strong> to find similar articles.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="/img/cosinesim.png" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
</center>
<p>The article 1 (attentional bias in smokers) has a theta angle of 45 degree and this corrispond to a similarity of 0.7. This means that the article 1 is related to both the topic brain attention mechanisms and drug addiction. Bolow the formula to calculate the cosine similarity in amultidimentional space.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{cossim}(x, y)=\frac{\sum_{i} x_{i} y_{i}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i} x_{i}^{2}} \sqrt{\sum_{i} y_{i}^{2}}}
\]</span></p>
<p>The x and y in the formula above are topic1 and topic2 respectively. By taking the summation of each topic x and y and dividing by the square root of the summations squared, we end up with the cosine similarity score.
We can also take in consideration the <strong>date of publication</strong> of the articles. The idea is that how far apart would two movies have to be for their date of publication, signify that they are sunstantially different. A decade shoudl be a reasonable starting point (e.g. an article about brain activity in the 80s are different the same article in the 90s).
We can use the code below to scale the difference in dates from zero to one.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def computeYearSimilarity(self, topic1, topic2, years):
       diff = abs(years[topic1] - years[topic2])
       sim = math.exp(-diff / 10.0)
       return sim
       </code></pre>
<p>From the code above we can see the <strong>exponential decay function</strong> is used. The similarity socre decays exponentially which is relly small after 10 years and almost nothing after 20 years as we can see from the figure below.</p>
<center>
<img src="/img/exponentialdecay.png" style="width:30.0%" />
</center>
<p>In the real world we can use test many variatins of this function to see what really produces the best recommendations with real articles.
To predict a rating for a given researcher and for a given topic can be made using a <a href="https://www.andreaperlato.com/mlpost/estimate-the-sucess-of-a-new-product-with-logistic-regression/"><strong>k nearest neighbors</strong></a>. The idea is to measure the similarity score between the article and all other article rates (e.g. number of cites). In this case <strong>nearest neighbors</strong> are the articles with the highest content-based similarity scores, and we can use the top 10 nearest articles to recommend to the users.</p>
