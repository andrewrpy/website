      <description>body {text-align: justify}Why Ensemble First of all, ensemble often have lower error than any individual method by themselves. It has also less overfitting leading us to a better performance in the test set. Each kind of learners that we might use has a sort of bias. Combining all of them, can reduce this bias. 
Adaptive Boosting in Random Forest In a Forest of Trees made with ADA Boost the trees are usually just One Node with Two Leaves that are called Stump, so it is a Forest of Stump.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Before the definition of the model it is always important to plot the distribution of our variable, finding unusual observation (points of leverage, hat value and outliers), missing data (understand if they are missing at random or not at random). Then, I always put the data in a multiple regression to see correlations and the presence of multicollinearity: is the phenomenon in which one predictor can be linearly predict from others with a substantial degree of accuracy.</description>

We use as an example the measurement of the Mass of mice (g). The red dots in the figure below represent mice that are not obese and the green dots represent mice obese. Based on this observation, we can pick a threshold, and when we have a new observation that has less mass than the threshold we can classify it as not obese.</description>

This can be useful for search engines, customer service automation, and any other instance where knowing the topics of documents is important. There are multiple methods of going about doing this. The most commonly used is Latent Dirichlet Allocation.The LDA builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.</description>

K-Means Clustering This is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The objective of K-means is simple: group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. The Step - 1 is to identify the number of clusters. Suppose we have K=3, the Step - 2 is to select randomly 3 data points and these are our Initial Cluster Points.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Oversampling and undersampling in data analysis are techniques used to adjust the class distribution of a data set. Both oversampling and undersampling involve introducing a bias to select more samples from one class than from another, to compensate for an imbalance that is either already present in the data. Data Imbalance can be of the following types:  Under-representation of a class in one or more important predictor variables.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Linear Discriminant Analysis was originally developed by R.A. Fisher to classify subjects into one of the two clearly defined groups. It was later expanded to classify subjects inoto more than two groups. It helps to find linear combination of original variables that provide the best possible separation between the groups. Linear Discriminant Analysis is focused on maximizing the separability among known categories. The problem is when 2 features are not sufficient to capture the most of variation.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Support Vector Machine SVM is a linear classifier. We can consider SVM for linearly separable binary sets. The goal is to design a hyperplane (is a subspace whose dimension is one less than that of its ambient space. If a space is 3-dimensional then its hyperplanes are the 2-dimensional planes).  The hyperplane classifies all the training vectors in two classes. We can have many possible hyperplanes that are able to classify correctly all the elements in the feature set, but the best choice will be the hyperplane that leaves the Maximum Margin from both classes.</description>

The Boruta Algorithm is a feature selection algorithm. As a matter of interest, Boruta algorithm derive its name from a demon in Slavic mythology who lived in pine forests. 
How Boruta Algorithm works  Firstly, it adds randomness to the given data set by creating shuffled copies of all features which are called Shadow Features.</description>

Decision Trees work great, but they are not flexible when it comes to classify new samples. It creates a bootstrapped dataset with the same size of the original, and to do that Random Forest randomly selects rows with replacement. After creating a bootstrap dataset, it creates a decision tree using the bootstrapped dataset, but using only a subset of variables at each step.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Application fraud refers to fraud committed by submitting a new credit application with fraudulent details to a credit provider. Normally, fraudsters collect the personal and financial data of innocent users from the identity documents, pay slips, bank statements, and other source documents to commit the application fraud. The information collected from all these documents will be either forged or sometimes the document itself will be stolen illegally or the details in the documents will be changed for the purpose of submitting a new credit application.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Generalized Addictive Models GAMs incorporates non linear form of predictions, and are useful when we have not linearity between response variable and predictors. GAMs doesnât force the predictors to a square as in polynomial regression, but GAMes tries to do a smooth line. The data we use here is biocapacity of different countries.

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Multicollinearity is a phenomenon in which two or more predictors in a multiple regression are highly correlated (R-squared more than 0.7), this can inflate our regression coefficients. We can test multicollinearity with the Variance Inflation Factor VIF is the ratio of variance in a model with multiple terms, divided by the variance of a model with one term alone. VIF = 1/1-R-squared. A rule of thumb is that if VIF &amp;gt; 10 then multicollinearity is high (a cutoff of 5 is also commonly used).</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}This is a regression technique that can helps us alleviate the problem of outliers. Robust Regression is a family of regression techniques that is really quite immune to the presence of outliers. Least Trimmed Squares Regression is a technique that fit a regression function and is not effected by the presence of outliers. Least Trimmed Squares Regression attempts to minimise the sum of squared residuals over a subset of k points.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}The Quantile regression gives a more comprehensive picture of the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable. Instead of estimating the model with average effects using the OLS linear model, the quantile regression produces different effects along the distribution (quantiles) of the dependent variable. The dependent variable is continuous with no zeros or too many repeated values.  Examples include estimating the effects of household income on food expenditures for low- and high-expenditure households, what are the factors influencing total medical expenditures for people with low, medium and high expenditures.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Naive Bayes is an effective and commonly-used, machine learning classifier. It is a probabilistic classifier that makes classifications using the Maximum A Posteriori decision rule in a Bayesian setting. It can also be represented using a very simple Bayesian network. Naive Bayes classifiers have been especially popular for text classification, and are a traditional solution for problems such as spam detection.
An intuitive explanation for the Maximum A Posteriori Probability MAP is to think probabilities as degrees of belief.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Extreme Gradient Boosting is extensively used because is fast and accurate, and can handle missing values.  Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.</description>

The table shows the business clients of a company that has just launched a new product online. Some of the clients responded positively to the ads by buying the product and other responded negatively by not buying the product. The last column of the table tells for each user if the user bought the product or not.</description>
