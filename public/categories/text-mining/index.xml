      <description>body {text-align: justify}What is Word2Vec and Doc2VecIt is a deep learning algorithm that draws context from phrases. Every textual document is represented in the form of a vector, and that is done through Vector Space Modelling (VSM). We can convert our text using One Hot Encoding. For example, having three words we can make a vector in a three dimentional space.
The problem with One Hot Encoding is that it doesnâ€™t help us to find similarities.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}We want to differentiate between spam (called spam) and non-spam (called ham) email based on the content. We use a training set of textual data that are already labeled spam/non-spam email.
We start removing empy columns, and we call our columns label and text.We also create a corpus, remove punctuation, transform everything into lowercase, remove numbers, and stop words. Then, we have to stamming the document, and finally we have a corpus of terms.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}We can use Unsupervised Classification (clustering) to learn more about text that we have to analyze. More specifically, we use Hierarchical clustering to cluster our text into groups that are the propensity to occur together. In this example, text are some tweet about Catalan Independence Referendum.
First step is to convert our tweets into a corpus, remove punctuation, transform everything into lowercase, remove numbers, and stop words.</description>
