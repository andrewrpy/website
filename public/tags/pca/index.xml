      <description>body {text-align: justify}This article is a summary of the StatQuest video made by Josh Starmer. Click here to see the video explained by Josh Starmer. 
The Principal Component Analysis is a deterministic method (given an input will always produce the same output). It is always good to perform a PCA: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a data reduction technique that transforms a larger number of correlated variables into a much smaller set of uncorrelated variables called Principal Components.</description>

It is always good to perform a PCA: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a data reduction technique that transforms a larger number of correlated variables into a much smaller set of uncorrelated variables called PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS. For example, we might use PCA to transform many correlated (and possibly redundant) variables into a less number of uncorrelated variables that retain as much information from the original set of variables.</description>
