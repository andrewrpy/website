      <description>body {text-align: justify}We want to differentiate between spam (called spam) and non-spam (called ham) email based on the content. We use a training set of textual data that are already labeled spam/non-spam email.
We start removing empy columns, and we call our columns label and text.We also create a corpus, remove punctuation, transform everything into lowercase, remove numbers, and stop words. Then, we have to stamming the document, and finally we have a corpus of terms.</description>
