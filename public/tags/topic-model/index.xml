      <description>body {text-align: justify}Studying related work within scientific literature is a crucial step in order to have a global overview about the scientific topics, but the amount of digital text data is growing exponentially and it is time consuming for researchers to find relevant information. Making scientific recommender systems smarter is crucial in order to help scientists in their bibliographical research phase.

This can be useful for search engines, customer service automation, and any other instance where knowing the topics of documents is important. There are multiple methods of going about doing this. The most commonly used is Latent Dirichlet Allocation.The LDA builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}The Topic Model is a type of statistical model to find the topics that occur in a collection of documents.It is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. For example, image to have some articles or a series of social media messages and we want to understand what is going on inside of them. A common tool to face this problem is via Unsupervised Machine Learning model.</description>
