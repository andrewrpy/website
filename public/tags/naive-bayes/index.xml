      <description>body {text-align: justify}It is a Probability Classifier. Naïve Bayes is the first algorithm that should be considered for solving Text Classification Problem which involves High Dimensional training Dataset. A few examples are: Sentiment Analysis and Classifying Topics on Social Media. It also refers to the Bayes’ Theorem also known as Bayes’ Law that give us a method to calculate the Conditional Probability: that is the probability of an event, based on previous knowledge available on the events.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Naive Bayes is an effective and commonly-used, machine learning classifier. It is a probabilistic classifier that makes classifications using the Maximum A Posteriori decision rule in a Bayesian setting. It can also be represented using a very simple Bayesian network. Naive Bayes classifiers have been especially popular for text classification, and are a traditional solution for problems such as spam detection.
An intuitive explanation for the Maximum A Posteriori Probability MAP is to think probabilities as degrees of belief.</description>
