      <description>body {text-align: justify}Most statistical methods assume that you’re working with complete matrices, vectors, and data frames. In most cases, we have to eliminate missing data before we address the substantive questions that led us to collect the data. We can eliminate missing data by removing cases with missing data, or replacing missing data with reasonable substitute values. In either case, the end result is a dataset without missing values.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}This is an example of how to extract customer information, such as the credit card number from an Ecommerce using Python.
We start loading the data and showing the first 10 observations. We also can see the number of columns (14) and rows (10000) of the dataset.

      <guid>/graphpost/sankey-diagram-with-d3js/</guid>
      <description>body {text-align: justify}The Sankey diagram is a way of visualizing the flow of data. A Sankey diagram consists of three sets of elements: the nodes, the links, and the instructions which determine their positions.The node is wherever the lines change direction. The second element is the edge, that connect the nodes together. These links have a value associated with them, which is represented by the thickness of the link.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}We used the data from the World Bank Indicators Portal which is an incredibly rich resource to make an animation of the Life Expectancy as a function of Gross Domestic Product per capita. More precisely, this is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year, converted at market exchange rates to current U.S. dollars, divided by the average population for the same year.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Graphs are a common method to visually illustrate relationships in the data,and they give a clear and compact idea and knowledge of matter contained in, at first sight. Graphs are extremely important and in data analysis they are considered the first statistics to perform.In this post we descrie the R package gganimate an extension of the ggplot2 package for creating animated ggplots. It provides a range of new functionality that can be added to the plot object in order to customize how it should change with time.</description>

In this example we have a dropdown menu on the left dynamically populated from the data. For each feature inside the dropdown menu we have a count of the unique values per each features.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}A 3D plot is quite popular, in particular in business presentation, but it is almost always inappropriately used. In fact, it is rare to see a 3D plot that could not be improved by turning into a regular 2D figure. Visualizations using 3D position scales can sometimes be appropriate, however. If the visualization is show it slowly rotation, rather than a static image from one prospective, will allow the viewer to discern where in 3D space different graphicla elements resides.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}I recently underwent to different tests of the so called Hair Analysis, and as a result I was given different conclusions. More precisely, I sent two of my hair samples to a two different labs, one in Italy and the second in Switzerland. The results are quite different as described by the table and graph below.  In 2011 a comprehensive review was published of the scientific literature on hair elemental (mineral) analysis.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}In this post, we use some fairly new technology of time series analysis namely neural nets and interactive charting tools.
INTERACTIVE GRAPH  The time series results should be presented interactively in order to highlight certain features.

      <description>body {text-align: justify}A lot of the times when dashboards are implemented they are with a very specific dataset. The problem with this is that we have to rebuild them from scratch every time. The advantage to use shiny is the possibility to create interactive dashboard or webapp without, and reusing the code already wirtten we can adapt it with new data. Here below, there are some examples of interactive dashboards.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}In this post we are going to create interactive graphs using Plotly.  Plotly allows us to create interactive charts, plot and maps with R. Plotly is designed to build a vast range of visualizations.  Crucially, it has the ability to automatically create interactive charts from the output ggplot2 which is the most abvanced R library to create scientific graphs.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Oftern, it is useful to provide interactive tables alonside charts. Responsive designed web content reflows itself dependent on the with of the browser window. There are many columns in the table which are over to the right-hand side and we need to scroll to access them.  So, could be really nice that the columns which don’t fit on the screen, are instead collapsed somehow, and optionally enable these.</description>
